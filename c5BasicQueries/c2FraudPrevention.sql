-- Fraud Prevention
-- Users have reported to the CashPal support team that they've been contacted by some suspicious users who claim to work for CashPal - you've been asked to write a query to find people impersonating CashPal employees. These suspicious users have been putting cashpal and support in their usernames to impersonate real employees. Fortunately, every CashPal employee has their is_admin field set to true, so we can determine if a user is an employee.

-- Challenge
-- Write a query that returns the name and username for every user that has the words cashpal or support somewhere in their username and is not an admin


SELECT name, username FROM users
WHERE (username LIKE "%cashpal%" OR username LIKE "%support%")
AND is_admin = FALSE
