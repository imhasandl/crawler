-- Discount Program
-- CashPal has decided to start two new discount programs targeting certain customers. The discounts are as follows:

-- All users over the age of 55 will qualify for a senior discount
-- In celebration of Canada Day - all Canadian (country_code "CA") users qualify for a discount
-- We want to return all the records from the users table, but we want to include an extra column to know whether each user qualifies for any of these discounts.

-- Challenge
-- Return all the data from the users table and a temporary column aliased to discount_eligible.

-- The discount_eligible column should have a boolean value of true or false depending on whether the user matches any discount conditions listed above.


SELECT *, IIF(age > 55 OR country_code = "CA", true, false) AS discount_eligible
FROM users
