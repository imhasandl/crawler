-- Average Ages
-- The CashPal marketing team was able to optimize their advertising with the help of the user data we pulled. However, they now want you to query the average age of users for each country that the business operates in, not just the United States.

-- Challenge
-- Write an SQL statement that returns two columns, the country_code and the average age of users for records with that country_code. The marketing team has asked that we round the average to the nearest whole number and rename the column that contains the average age to average_age.


SELECT country_code, round(avg(age)) AS average_age FROM users
GROUP BY country_code
