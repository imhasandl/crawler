-- Create a Foreign Key
-- We managed to fix the banks table but now we want to have the added safety of foreign key constraints on our users table. For this challenge, the users table contains a bank_id, we want to make sure that the user's bank_id references an id from the banks table.

-- Challenge
-- Change the table creation statement to include a FOREIGN KEY constraint on the users table named fk_banks that REFERENCES an ID from the banks table.


CREATE TABLE banks (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    location TEXT NOT NULL,
    routing_number INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    age INTEGER NOT NULL,
    country_code TEXT NOT NULL,
    username TEXT UNIQUE,
    password TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_admin BOOLEAN,
    bank_id INTEGER,
    CONSTRAINT fk_banks
    FOREIGN KEY (bank_id)
    REFERENCES banks(id)
);

-- TEST SUITE, DON'T TOUCH BELOW THIS LINE --

SELECT sql AS users_table FROM sqlite_schema WHERE type='table' AND name='users';
