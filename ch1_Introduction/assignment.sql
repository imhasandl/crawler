-- In this course, we will be building the database for a pretend PayPal clone called CashPal! Storing information related to people's money, transactions, and identity is very important! So we will need to make sure we use proper conventions to build a safe, and reliable database architecture that our users can rely on.

SELECT * FROM users;
